# AFRICAI/MICCAI AI in Medical Imaging in Africa Summer School - 2023
Materials for the 1st AFRICAI Summer School session for the session
"Model Development 1: Model-centric best practices and common pitfalls and open access infrastructures". 
For more information, see the AFRICAI website: https://africai.org/summer-school/. 

# 1. Open Access infrastructures

# 2. AI Toolboxes

# 3. MONAI

# 4. Monitoring

# 5. Model and hyperparameter selection

# 6. Processing
Given that we have our dataset ready and at hand and have our preprocessing and AI algorithm,
we nned a compute power to run the analysis. 
Eg-
Google collab: is a free notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud.
