# AFRICAI/MICCAI AI in Medical Imaging in Africa Summer School - 2023
Materials for the 1st AFRICAI Summer School session for the session
"Model Development 2: Model-centric best practices and common pitfalls and open access infrastructures". 
For more information, see the AFRICAI website: https://africai.org/summer-school/. 

Open access infrastructures (Martijn) 
 
# 1. Open Access infrastructures
*Open source* in software development refers to the practice of making the source code of a project available to the public to be used, modified, and redistributed.

*Infrastructure* incompasses everything from frameworks to platforms, libraries, toolboses and notebook environments.


The LF AI & Data landscape explores open source projects in Artificial Intelligence and Data and their respective sub-domains. More information can be found here. https://landscapeapp.cncf.io/lfai/

# 2. AI Toolboxes
Several open source/open access AI toolboxes are available for deep-learning projects. 

# 3. MONAI

# 4. Monitoring

# 5. Model and hyperparameter selection

# 6. Processing
Given that we have our dataset ready and at hand and have our preprocessing and AI algorithm,
we need a compute power to run the analysis. 
Eg-
Google collab: is a free notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud.
