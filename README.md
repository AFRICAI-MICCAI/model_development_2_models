# AFRICAI/MICCAI AI in Medical Imaging in Africa Summer School - 2023
Materials for the 1st AFRICAI Summer School session for the session
"Model Development 2: Model-centric best practices and common pitfalls and open access infrastructures". 
For more information, see the AFRICAI website: https://africai.org/summer-school/. 

Open access infrastructures (Martijn) 
 
# 1. Open Access infrastructures
*Open source* in software development refers to the practice of making the source code of a project available to the public to be used, modified, and redistributed.

*Infrastructure* incompasses everything from frameworks to platforms, libraries, toolboses and notebook environments.


The LF AI & Data landscape explores open source projects in Artificial Intelligence and Data and their respective sub-domains. More information can be found here. https://landscapeapp.cncf.io/lfai/

# 2. AI Toolboxes
Several open source/open access AI toolboxes are available for deep-learning projects. 

# 3. MONAI

Is a open-source framework built for accelerating research and clinical collaboration in medical imaging. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for deep learning applications in medical image analysis. Developed with a focus on flexibility and ease of use, MONAI simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for tasks like image segmentation, classification, and registration. Unlike general-purpose deep learning libraries, MONAI is tailored specifically for medical imaging tasks and offers a standardized and efficient framework.

Aside from the tutorial provide here, we would also recommend checking out their in depth tutorials on how to use it for various medical imaging tasks. https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main 

# 4. Monitoring

# 5. Model and hyperparameter selection

# 6. Processing
Given that we have our dataset ready and at hand and have our preprocessing and AI algorithm,
we need a compute power to run the analysis. 
Eg-
Google collab: is a free notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud.

# 7. Pre-trained models
 A collection of pretrained medical imaging models can be found in these platforms.
